# Date Fruit Classification using Deep Learning 
📌 **Overview**
This project focuses on developing an optimized neural network architecture for classifying seven types of date fruits using deep learning techniques. By experimenting with different network depths, we improved classification accuracy beyond traditional machine learning models.

✨ Features
✅ Implemented Wide Layered, Bi-layered, Tri-layered, and Optimized Neural Networks to enhance classification performance.
✅ Achieved 94.8% accuracy, outperforming models like Logistic Regression, ANN, and Stacking (92.8%).
✅ Optimized the neural network architecture through experimentation with varying depths.
✅ Designed and tested multiple deep learning models to achieve the best accuracy.
✅ Demonstrated the effectiveness of deep learning in fruit classification tasks.
